**Title**: From Collection to Closet
**What are questions that you want to explore with this visualization?**
- What fits feel fitting even across decades and materials?
- How can we use the collection to make micro collections that are themselves expressions of creativity?
- How can you make the collection _you're own?_

**Why are you creating an interactive/narrative version of it?** 
So that it feels akin to pulling pieces while shopping. 

**What will narrativity and interactivity add to this project that was not possible in static form?**
I will use an introductory screen that underscores the significance of the experience, then use taxonomy (pulls, closet, wardrobe, outfits) that abstracts above "artifacts" and <divs>.

**Which dataset is used? **
Keywords in hats (headware, helmets), shoes (sneakers, footwear, heels), and tops (dresses, outerwear, shirts). 

**What are the properties of the data set? How many data points, what's the quality of the data etc?**
I'm relying on titles, materials, notes, and colors from vibrant.js.

**Which visualization method is used and why?**
In a way, this has become a product more than a visualization. It leverages data as filters.
