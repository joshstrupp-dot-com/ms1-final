# Piece by Piece

Piece by Piece is an immersive web experience designed to explore and curate a diverse collection of museum artifacts interactively. Upon entering, users are greeted with an introduction screen that transitions into the main gallery, showcasing a vast array of items through an infinite scrolling mechanism.

The application features a gallery section where users can browse artifacts, apply filters based on categories like museum, topic, and year, and effortlessly load more items as they navigate. Enhanced by data visualizations charts powered by D3.js, the platform offers intuitive data representations, allowing users to gain insights into the collection's distribution and diversity.

A standout feature is the Closet module, where users can add their favorite artifacts to a personalized "Closet." Overlays enrich the user experience by displaying detailed information and metadata for each artifact, as well as an AI-generated summary.

Performance is optimized through lazy loading of images and responsive design, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices. Additionally, the application incorporates interactive tooltips and animations to enhance usability and engagement.

Piece by Piece offers a harmonious blend of exploration, visualization, and personalization, making the journey through museum collections both educational and enjoyable.
