LONDON TIMES.”', 'Joseph Klein (frequently spelled Kline) “Fritz” Emmet (1841-1891) was a singer, minstrel performer, impersonator, character actor, and comedian born in St. Louis, Missouri. He was drawn to the stage after apprenticing with a sign maker who also created sets for local playhouses. At around age seventeen he began working as a snare drummer for Joseph Escher’s orchestra. He also showed a talent for yodeling and soon got a job with a local minstrel show. Moving on to New York, he appeared with Dan Bryant’s Minstrels, a German blackface group, and then in variety shows. Over time he developed a character called ""Dutch,"" who wore wooden shoes and a cap and sang in fractured English. In 1870, Emmet made his debut in the role that would turn him into one of the most successful performers of his time, as the lead inFritz, Our Cousin German. Portraying a young man seeking his long-lost sister while finding love, with a signature song called “Emmet’s Lullaby,” he appeared as Fritz on stages throughout the United States and Europe for the rest of his life. His other roles includedCarl, the Fiddler(1871)Max, the Merry Swiss Boy(1873), andFritz in Ireland(1879). His appeal was enhanced by his dancing skills, his mastery of musical instruments like the guitar, violin, and harmonica, his Irish tenor voice, and his personal charm. Emmet also became celebrated for the eccentric mansion he built on fifteen acres overlooking the Hudson River near Albany, New York. ""Fritz Villa,"" as it came to be known, featured an eclectic mix of towers, gables, stained glass windows--even a windmill--and was influenced by Emmet\'s exposure to various architectural styles during his travels through Europe.', 'This print was produced by Maclure & Macdonald, a lithographic and engraving firm established by Andrew MacLure and Archibold Grey MacDonald in Glasgow, Scotland in 1835.

The chairman, John Hancock, sits in an upholstered armchair at a table in the foreground. A group of men stand before the table. The rest of the men are seated or standing around the perimeter of the room. A man seated at a table at right appears to be taking notes. This recognizable image was used in classrooms, public buildings and textbooks throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries and was based on a reverse presentation of the 1817-1818 painting by John Trumbull in the US Capitol or the earlier painting currently owned by Yale.', 'The original painting by Trumbull shows the drafting committee presenting their draft to the 2nd Continental Congress, which took place on June 28th, 1776 and not the signing which mostly took place between July 2 and August 2. The print indicates the scene was from July 4th 1776. John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston, the committee who drafted the document are standing in front of Hancock. 42 of the 56 signers are depicted as well as the few members of Congress who took part in the debates but did not sign such as John Dickinson. Trumbull created his work by interviewing Jefferson in Paris, then Adams, and finally as many of the delegates as he could-36 out of the 48 present- to preserve their likenesses for history. Trumbull worked on the image for more than three decades.', 'Napoleon Sarony (1821–1896), the graphic artist and lithographer, was born in Quebec and trained under several lithography firms including Currier & Ives and H.R.

In 1846, Sarony collaborated with another former apprentice of Nathaniel Currier, Henry B. Major and created Sarony & Major Lithography firm. Joseph F. Knapp joined the firm in 1857. Sarony, Major & Knapp earned a solid reputation for lithography and the company was especially known for its fine art chromolithography. Unfortunately, by the 1870s, the firm shifted focus to the more profitable area of advertising.

Since the family never sat for a formal portrait, artists relied on earlier photographs of its members to create their compositions, portraying the family members as they would have appeared at the start of Lincoln’s presidency. This post-1880 black and white print depicts the family members as they would have appeared at the start of Lincoln’s presidency. At left, a bespectacled President Lincoln sits reading from a book. Opposite him, sits Mary Todd Lincoln, holding a rose on her lap. Between them stand their three children, Tad, Willie, and Robert. In the background, the Capitol building is visible between two segments of drapery. By the time this print was produced sometime after 1880, Robert was the only surviving Lincoln child, Willie having died in 1862 and Tad in 1871.', 'This print was produced by the lithography firm of Kurz & Allison. Louis Kurz (1835–1921) was an Austrian immigrant who settled in Chicago during the 1850s, where he formed a partnership with Henry Seifert of Milwaukee. He later fought for the Union Army during the Civil War. After the conflict he co-founded the Chicago Lithographic Company. When the company’s assets were destroyed during the Chicago Fire of 1871, Kurz started a new business with his partner, financial backer, and business manager, Alexander Allison. Their partnership is noted for producing a commemorative print series of Civil War battle scenes, several of which are in the NMAH’s collections.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['& Access', 'Peters Print']",,,,"['Lincoln', 'Lincoln', 'Lincoln', 'Lincoln', 'Lincoln', 'Mary Todd Lincoln', 'Tad', 'Willie', 'Robert', 'Robert', 'Lincoln', 'Willie', 'Tad', 'Louis Kurz', 'Henry Seifert', 'Kurz', 'Alexander Allison']","['Northern American', 'Austrian', 'Civil War', 'Chicago Fire', 'Civil War']",,,,,,,,,['Harry T.

Horace Thayer (1811-c. 1874) was a map dealer and in 1845 or 1846 the men opened a shop in New York. The partnership appears to have dissolved in 1847.

He also created portraits and sheet music covers, but after 1831 he specialized in political cartoons. He moved from Philadelphia to New York City in 1837 and often worked with Henry R. Robinson. Failing eyesight eventually led Clay to give up art, and he again relocated, this time to Delaware, where he worked as a court clerk. He died of tuberculosis in New York in 1857.', 'Henry R.

In 1842 he was arrested for selling obscene pictures and books in his print and book shop.

Her signature serves as the title. This print is modeled after a well-known daguerreotype by M. A. and S. Root and is on thin, white paper which has been pasted to heavier cream-colored paper.', 'Jenny Lind (1820-1887) was an opera singer often described as “The Swedish Nightingale” for the range, purity, and melodiousness of her soprano voice. Born Johanna Maria Lind in Stockholm, Lind trained at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, began performing in her teens, and was soon creating a sensation on tours throughout Europe. When she made her London debut in 1847, frenzied theatergoers set off a stampede as they entered the theater. Queen Victoria was among those who attended that opening night performance. The Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen is said to have fallen in love with Lind and to have written fairy tales with her in mind, including “The Nightingale.” She also won the admiration of composers like Robert Schumann, Hector Berlioz, and Felix Mendelssohn, who became a close friend. In addition to Lind’s vocal gifts, she was greatly admired as a model of piety, simplicity, and generosity. In 1849, although only 29 years old, she announced her retirement from opera and turned to performing Romantic and Swedish folk songs. She resumed her operatic career in 1850, when she launched an American tour under the management of the showman P. T. Barnum. He promoted her arrival with such fanfare that she was greeted by a crowd numbering in the thousands when she sailed into New York’s harbor. She traveled across the United States and to Cuba and Canada in the year that followed, often donating her profits to the endowment of free schools in Sweden and other charitable causes. Lind and Barnum ended their partnership in 1851, but she continued to tour on her own for another year.', 'In 1852, Jenny Lind married her accompanist, Otto Goldschmidt, and continued to appear in occasional European concerts as Jenny Lind Goldschmidt. She died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 67.

Root and is on thin, white paper which has been pasted to heavier cream-colored paper.', 'Jenny Lind (1820-1887) was an opera singer often described as “The Swedish Nightingale” for the range, purity, and melodiousness of her soprano voice. Born Johanna Maria Lind in Stockholm, Lind trained at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, began performing in her teens, and was soon creating a sensation on tours throughout Europe. When she made her London debut in 1847, frenzied theatergoers set off a stampede as they entered the theater. Queen Victoria was among those who attended that opening night performance. The Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen is said to have fallen in love with Lind and to have written fairy tales with her in mind, including “The Nightingale.” She also won the admiration of composers like Robert Schumann, Hector Berlioz, and Felix Mendelssohn, who became a close friend. In addition to Lind’s vocal gifts, she was greatly admired as a model of piety, simplicity, and generosity. In 1849, although only 29 years old, she announced her retirement from opera and turned to performing Romantic and Swedish folk songs. She resumed her operatic career in 1850, when she launched an American tour under the management of the showman P. T. Barnum. He promoted her arrival with such fanfare that she was greeted by a crowd numbering in the thousands when she sailed into New York’s harbor. She traveled across the United States and to Cuba and Canada in the year that followed, often donating her profits to the endowment of free schools in Sweden and other charitable causes. Lind and Barnum ended their partnership in 1851, but she continued to tour on her own for another year.', 'In 1852, Jenny Lind married her accompanist, Otto Goldschmidt, and continued to appear in occasional European concerts as Jenny Lind Goldschmidt. She died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 67. Although critics have debated whether her talent measured up to her reputation, her legendary popularity lives on in memorials and monuments around the world. She has inspired books, films, and a series of Swedish banknotes, while schools, streets, parks, hospitals, pies, clothing, and cigars all carry her name.

His reputation for informal brawling earned him the nickname the “Benecia Boy” and captured the attention of an English trainer named Jim Cusick, who moved with Heenan back to New York. Because fighting was illegal in the United States at that time, Heenan participated in his first national heavyweight bout in Canada in 1858. He lost the match to reigning champion John Morrissey in what some claimed to be an unfair fight because of crowd interference. After Morrissey retired from the ring, Heenan became national champion by default. He fought his second match—this time against Tom Sayers in 1860—in a field in Farnborough, Hampshire, England. Bare knuckle fighting was also illegal in England, and the confrontation attracted widespread public attention.

Again, there were charges that the fight had been unfair, this time because of biased calls by the referee. Heenan also later claimed he’d been drugged.

Romantic scenes picture devoted husbands with their contented, dutiful wives. In these prints, young women educated in reading, music, needlework, the arts, the language of flowers, basic math and science are subjugated to their family’s needs.', 'These prints became popular as lithography was introduced to 19th Century Americans. As a new art form, it was affordable for the masses and provided a means to share visual information by crossing the barriers of race, class and language. Sentimental prints encouraged the artistic endeavors of schoolgirls and promoted the ambitions of amateur artists, while serving as both moral instruction and home or business decoration. They are a pictorial record of our romanticized past.', 'This hand colored print is a three-quarter length portrait of two girls, the older girl with her arm around the shoulder of the younger girl. They wear simple dress; one pink and the other blue. Rose bushes and a balustrade are in the background. The younger girls hold some flowers in one hand.', 'This print was produced by the lithographic firm E.B. & E.C. Kellogg. Edmund Burke Kellogg and Elijah Chapman Kellogg were brothers of the founder of the Kellogg lithography firm, Daniel Wright Kellogg. After D.W. Kellogg moved west, his two brothers took over the family lithography firm in 1840 and changed the name to E.B. & E.C. Kellogg. The youngest of the four Kellogg brothers, these two were responsible for the continued success of the family firm. These two brothers were also involved in the eventual partnerships between the company and Horace Thayer in 1845 or 1846, John Chenevard Comstock in 1848 and William Henry Bulkeley in 1867.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Needham, D.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['& Access', 'Peters Print']",,,,"['Edmund Burke Ke', 'Elijah Chapman Ke', 'Daniel Wright Ke', 'D', 'Ke', 'Horace Thayer', 'John Chenevard Comstock', 'William Henry Bulkeley']","['Victorian', 'Century Americans']",,,,,,,,,['Harry T.
