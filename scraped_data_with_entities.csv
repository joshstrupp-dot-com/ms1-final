Utilizing only a dramatically posed figure, an inspirational quote, and a vivid blue background, this poster does not attempt to recruit troops, sell war bonds, or encourage hard work in the factories. Rather, it sends a general message to fellow black Americans to “do our part.”', 'Louis himself, who had turned down a commission when he enlisted in the army, later worked to integrate athletic programs and raise money for military relief funds. He also boxed in exhibition matches to entertain the troops, and at the end of the war, the army commended him for his “exceptionally meritorious service.”', 'Nacido cerca de Lafayette, Alabama', 'Según el periodista y político de Harlem Earl Brown, Joe Louis era tan popular en los años treinta que la “enorme imagen” del campeón de peso completo “en atuendo de pelea” adornaba muchos de los sitios de reunión de la comunidad afroamericana. El mismo atractivo popular de Louis, y un atuendo de pelea distinto, hicieron de este cartel un vehículo de propaganda sumamente efectivo durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Con tan solo una figura en pose dramática, una cita inspiradora y un fondo de color azul vivo, este cartel no está hecho para reclutar tropas, vender bonos de guerra o exhortar al trabajo duro en las fábricas. Está hecho para comunicar a los compatriotas afroamericanos el mensaje de que hay que “cumplir con nuestra parte”.', 'Louis, quien había rechazado un cargo de oficial cuando se enlistó en el ejército, trabajó más tarde a favor de la integración racial de los programas atléticos y recaudó dinero para los fondos de ayuda a los militares. También ofreció peleas de exhibición para entretener a las tropas, y al terminar la guerra el ejército lo distinguió por su “servicio de mérito excepcional”.']",,['NPG.88.24'],['CC0'],['Print'],['Color photolithographic poster with halftone'],"['Image: 96 x 67.2cm (37 13/16 x 26 7/16"")', 'Sheet: 101.5 x 72.3cm (39 15/16 x 28 7/16"")', 'Board: 106.7 x 72.4cm (42 x 28 1/2"")', 'A to G Depth: 1 1/2""']","['Weapon\\Gun', 'Weapon\\Gun\\Rifle', 'Costume\\Headgear\\Helmet', 'Poster', 'Weapon\\Gun\\Bayonet', 'Joe Louis Barrow: Male', 'Joe Louis Barrow: Sports and Recreation\\Athlete\\Boxer', 'Joe Louis Barrow: Military and Intelligence\\Army', 'Joe Louis Barrow: Civilian awards\\Congressional Gold Medal', 'Portrait']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Historical Collection of the Insurance Company of North America']","['Fire Fighting', 'Fraternal Associations']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Beginning in the late 18th century, some volunteer fire fighters began to wear hats painted with their company’s name to identify themselves at chaotic fire scenes. During the 19th century, these fire hats became more ornate, as portraits of historical figures, patriotic scenes, allegorical images, or company icons were painted alongside the company’s name, motto, or founding date. Made of pressed felt, these “stove-pipe” hats were primarily used in Philadelphia, but other nearby cities such as Baltimore and Washington adopted them as well. Fire hats were personal items with the owner’s initials often painted on the top of the hat. While these hats were worn at fires, they are more colloquially known as “parade hats.” Fire companies commonly marched in the many parades of the period and these ornate hats contributed to the visual culture of their day. These distinguishing features in a company’s regalia often proclaimed the members’ cultural and political identity as well as their position on contested topics such as work, religion and immigration.', 'This fire hat dates to the first half of the 19th century. The hat is painted black overall with a painted portrait of Samuel Ringgold in the center framed in gold. Red banners with gold trim flow around the portrait that read “RINGGOLD/HOSE Co.” in gold paint. The company’s initials “RHC” are painted in gold script on the back of the hat. The owner’s initials “H.M.” are inside an outline of a shield on the crown of the hat. This hat was likely used by a member of the Ringgold Hose Company No. 33 of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded in 1847 and operated until 1871 when Philadelphia’s paid firefighting department was established. While many firefighting companies chose past heroes of the Revolution and Early Republic as their namesakes, others selected contemporary military and political figures. Samuel Ringgold was a hero of the Mexican-American War best known for his innovations in artillery deployment. He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Palo Alto in 1846.']",,,,,,,['Ringgold Hose Company'],"['Ringgold, Samuel']",,,,,,,,

During the 19th century, these fire hats became more ornate, as portraits of historical figures, patriotic scenes, allegorical images, or company icons were painted alongside the company’s name, motto, or founding date. Made of pressed felt, these “stove-pipe” hats were primarily used in Philadelphia, but other nearby cities such as Baltimore and Washington adopted them as well. Fire hats were personal items with the owner’s initials often painted on the top of the hat. While these hats were worn at fires, they are more colloquially known as “parade hats.” Fire companies commonly marched in the many parades of the period and these ornate hats contributed to the visual culture of their day. These distinguishing features in a company’s regalia often proclaimed the members’ cultural and political identity as well as their position on contested topics such as work, religion and immigration.', 'This hat was used in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during the first half of the 19th century. The hat is painted light blue, with an image of a spread-winged eagle in front of a sunburst gripping a red banner in its talons that reads “COLUMBIA HOSE COMPANY” in gold. The imagery on this hat is very similar to other fire hats in the collection—2005.0233.0029 and 2005.0233.0034—pointing to a common artist or local artistic style. The company’s initials “CHC” (Columbia Hose Company) are painted in gold calligraphic script on the back of the hat. The owner’s initials “J.M.I.” are painted in gold on the crown of the hat. The Columbia Hose Company No. 8 of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was founded in 1806, on the block of 7th and Cherry Streets and operated until 1871 when Philadelphia’s paid firefighting department was established. The bald eagle was adopted by the Continental Congress as the national symbol of the United States in 1782 and was a frequently used icon among early American volunteer fire departments.']",,,,,['Always Ready: Fighting Fire in the 19th Century'],,['Columbia Hose Company'],,,,['National Museum of American History'],,,,,
