Although he acted in several of the great tragic dramas, he became best known for his starring role inNick of the Woods, a melodrama set on the Kentucky frontier. Making his debut in 1839, at a time when melodramas were especially popular with the American public, Proctor portrayed a savage Indian fighter nicknamed Nathan Slaughter, or Nick and also known as the ""Jibbenainosay"", which was said to be an Indian expression for the “spirit that walks."" The play was written by the Spanish-American dramatist Louisa Medina (ca 1813-1838), who adapted it from an 1837 novel of the same name by American author Robert Montgomery Bird (1806-1854). Procter portrayed Nick some 2500 times in the United States and Europe until he retired from the stage in the 1880s.', 'There is no information available about the lithographer for this print though in the collection there is a similar image with more detail and different coloring and ""letters"" that was produced by Currier and Ives.

LONDON TIMES.”', 'Joseph Klein (frequently spelled Kline) “Fritz” Emmet (1841-1891) was a singer, minstrel performer, impersonator, character actor, and comedian born in St. Louis, Missouri. He was drawn to the stage after apprenticing with a sign maker who also created sets for local playhouses. At around age seventeen he began working as a snare drummer for Joseph Escher’s orchestra. He also showed a talent for yodeling and soon got a job with a local minstrel show. Moving on to New York, he appeared with Dan Bryant’s Minstrels, a German blackface group, and then in variety shows. Over time he developed a character called ""Dutch,"" who wore wooden shoes and a cap and sang in fractured English. In 1870, Emmet made his debut in the role that would turn him into one of the most successful performers of his time, as the lead inFritz, Our Cousin German. Portraying a young man seeking his long-lost sister while finding love, with a signature song called “Emmet’s Lullaby,” he appeared as Fritz on stages throughout the United States and Europe for the rest of his life. His other roles includedCarl, the Fiddler(1871)Max, the Merry Swiss Boy(1873), andFritz in Ireland(1879). His appeal was enhanced by his dancing skills, his mastery of musical instruments like the guitar, violin, and harmonica, his Irish tenor voice, and his personal charm. Emmet also became celebrated for the eccentric mansion he built on fifteen acres overlooking the Hudson River near Albany, New York. ""Fritz Villa,"" as it came to be known, featured an eclectic mix of towers, gables, stained glass windows--even a windmill--and was influenced by Emmet\'s exposure to various architectural styles during his travels through Europe.', 'This print was produced by Maclure & Macdonald, a lithographic and engraving firm established by Andrew MacLure and Archibold Grey MacDonald in Glasgow, Scotland in 1835.

Since the family never sat for a formal portrait, artists relied on earlier photographs of its members to create their compositions, portraying the family members as they would have appeared at the start of Lincoln’s presidency. This post-1880 black and white print depicts the family members as they would have appeared at the start of Lincoln’s presidency. At left, a bespectacled President Lincoln sits reading from a book. Opposite him, sits Mary Todd Lincoln, holding a rose on her lap. Between them stand their three children, Tad, Willie, and Robert. In the background, the Capitol building is visible between two segments of drapery. By the time this print was produced sometime after 1880, Robert was the only surviving Lincoln child, Willie having died in 1862 and Tad in 1871.', 'This print was produced by the lithography firm of Kurz & Allison. Louis Kurz (1835–1921) was an Austrian immigrant who settled in Chicago during the 1850s, where he formed a partnership with Henry Seifert of Milwaukee. He later fought for the Union Army during the Civil War. After the conflict he co-founded the Chicago Lithographic Company. When the company’s assets were destroyed during the Chicago Fire of 1871, Kurz started a new business with his partner, financial backer, and business manager, Alexander Allison. Their partnership is noted for producing a commemorative print series of Civil War battle scenes, several of which are in the NMAH’s collections.']","['& Access', 'Peters Print']","['Lincoln', 'Lincoln', 'Lincoln', 'Lincoln', 'Lincoln', 'Mary Todd Lincoln', 'Tad', 'Willie', 'Robert', 'Robert', 'Lincoln', 'Willie', 'Tad', 'Louis Kurz', 'Henry Seifert', 'Kurz', 'Alexander Allison']","['Northern American', 'Austrian', 'Civil War', 'Chicago Fire', 'Civil War']",['Harry T.

He also created portraits and sheet music covers, but after 1831 he specialized in political cartoons. He moved from Philadelphia to New York City in 1837 and often worked with Henry R. Robinson. Failing eyesight eventually led Clay to give up art, and he again relocated, this time to Delaware, where he worked as a court clerk. He died of tuberculosis in New York in 1857.', 'Henry R.

In 1842 he was arrested for selling obscene pictures and books in his print and book shop.

In 1849, although only 29 years old, she announced her retirement from opera and turned to performing Romantic and Swedish folk songs.

At the age of 17, he headed west to the Gold Rush town of Benecia, California, where he worked as a strong man and enforcer in labor and political disputes. His reputation for informal brawling earned him the nickname the “Benecia Boy” and captured the attention of an English trainer named Jim Cusick, who moved with Heenan back to New York. Because fighting was illegal in the United States at that time, Heenan participated in his first national heavyweight bout in Canada in 1858. He lost the match to reigning champion John Morrissey in what some claimed to be an unfair fight because of crowd interference. After Morrissey retired from the ring, Heenan became national champion by default. He fought his second match—this time against Tom Sayers in 1860—in a field in Farnborough, Hampshire, England. Bare knuckle fighting was also illegal in England, and the confrontation attracted widespread public attention. It quickly turned brutal and chaotic, and ended in a draw after five rounds when the police threatened to intervene.', 'The match has been described as the first world title fight, and it led to the establishment of a boxing code of conduct that included three-minute rounds, mandatory gloves, and ten-second counts after knockdowns. Heenan lost his third and final world title match, also in England, to a fighter named Tom King in 1863. Again, there were charges that the fight had been unfair, this time because of biased calls by the referee. Heenan also later claimed he’d been drugged. He devoted his final years to the gambling business. He died at the age of 38 after contracting tuberculosis in what was then the Wyoming territory.

Romantic scenes picture devoted husbands with their contented, dutiful wives. In these prints, young women educated in reading, music, needlework, the arts, the language of flowers, basic math and science are subjugated to their family’s needs.', 'These prints became popular as lithography was introduced to 19th Century Americans. As a new art form, it was affordable for the masses and provided a means to share visual information by crossing the barriers of race, class and language. Sentimental prints encouraged the artistic endeavors of schoolgirls and promoted the ambitions of amateur artists, while serving as both moral instruction and home or business decoration. They are a pictorial record of our romanticized past.', 'This hand colored print is a three-quarter length portrait of two girls, the older girl with her arm around the shoulder of the younger girl. They wear simple dress; one pink and the other blue. Rose bushes and a balustrade are in the background. The younger girls hold some flowers in one hand.', 'This print was produced by the lithographic firm E.B. & E.C. Kellogg. Edmund Burke Kellogg and Elijah Chapman Kellogg were brothers of the founder of the Kellogg lithography firm, Daniel Wright Kellogg. After D.W. Kellogg moved west, his two brothers took over the family lithography firm in 1840 and changed the name to E.B. & E.C. Kellogg. The youngest of the four Kellogg brothers, these two were responsible for the continued success of the family firm. These two brothers were also involved in the eventual partnerships between the company and Horace Thayer in 1845 or 1846, John Chenevard Comstock in 1848 and William Henry Bulkeley in 1867.']","['& Access', 'Peters Print']","['Edmund Burke Ke', 'Elijah Chapman Ke', 'Daniel Wright Ke', 'D', 'Ke', 'Horace Thayer', 'John Chenevard Comstock', 'William Henry Bulkeley']","['Victorian', 'Century Americans']",['Harry T.
