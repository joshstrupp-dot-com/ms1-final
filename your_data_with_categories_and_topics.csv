LONDON TIMES.”', 'Joseph Klein (frequently spelled Kline) “Fritz” Emmet (1841-1891) was a singer, minstrel performer, impersonator, character actor, and comedian born in St. Louis, Missouri. He was drawn to the stage after apprenticing with a sign maker who also created sets for local playhouses. At around age seventeen he began working as a snare drummer for Joseph Escher’s orchestra. He also showed a talent for yodeling and soon got a job with a local minstrel show. Moving on to New York, he appeared with Dan Bryant’s Minstrels, a German blackface group, and then in variety shows. Over time he developed a character called ""Dutch,"" who wore wooden shoes and a cap and sang in fractured English. In 1870, Emmet made his debut in the role that would turn him into one of the most successful performers of his time, as the lead inFritz, Our Cousin German. Portraying a young man seeking his long-lost sister while finding love, with a signature song called “Emmet’s Lullaby,” he appeared as Fritz on stages throughout the United States and Europe for the rest of his life. His other roles includedCarl, the Fiddler(1871)Max, the Merry Swiss Boy(1873), andFritz in Ireland(1879). His appeal was enhanced by his dancing skills, his mastery of musical instruments like the guitar, violin, and harmonica, his Irish tenor voice, and his personal charm. Emmet also became celebrated for the eccentric mansion he built on fifteen acres overlooking the Hudson River near Albany, New York. ""Fritz Villa,"" as it came to be known, featured an eclectic mix of towers, gables, stained glass windows--even a windmill--and was influenced by Emmet\'s exposure to various architectural styles during his travels through Europe.', 'This print was produced by Maclure & Macdonald, a lithographic and engraving firm established by Andrew MacLure and Archibold Grey MacDonald in Glasgow, Scotland in 1835. The firm was considered to be the first in the United Kingdom to use steam power for lithographic printing. Frank MacLure, one of Andrew’s sons, became Queen Victoria’s lithographer in the 1880s.

There are two unidentified women looking on. They are in the lavish garden of the family estate, with the great country house pictured in the background.', 'The parable of the Prodigal Son or the Lost Son is among the best-known Christian morality tales and is found in Luke 15:11-32. The youngest of the two sons demands his share of his father’s estate which the father gives him. Shortly after, he runs off and squanders the wealth “in wild living.” Finding himself destitute, he returns to his father, repents his ways, and begs to be allowed to serve as a hired servant. The father rejoices at the return of his son “who was lost and is found.” Meanwhile, the obedient, older son is angry and refuses to join the celebration. His father pleads with him to forgive and to understand his joy.', 'This print was produced by E.B. Kellogg and E.C. Kellogg and Kelloggs & Thayer after an engraving by Amos Doolittle. Edmund Burke Kellogg (1809-1872) and Elijah Chapman Kellogg (1811-1881) were brothers of the founder of the Kellogg lithography firm, Daniel Wright Kellogg (1807-1874). After D.W. Kellogg moved west, his two brothers took over the family lithography firm in 1840 and changed the name to E.B. & E.C. Kellogg. The younger two of the four Kellogg brothers, they were responsible for the continued success of the family firm. These two brothers were also involved in the eventual partnerships between the company and Horace Thayer in 1845 or 1846, John Chenevard Comstock (1818-1862) in 1848 and William Henry Bulkeley (1840-1902) in 1867. The print was produced by the lithography firm of Kelloggs & Thayer. Kelloggs and Thayer was the first partnership formed by Elijah Chapman Kellogg (1811-1881) and Edmund Burke Kellogg (1809-1872) after they took over the family firm from their brother Daniel Wright Kellogg (1807-1874). Horace Thayer (1811-c. 1874) was a map dealer and in 1845 or 1846 the men opened a shop in New York. The partnership appears to have dissolved in 1847.

Both appear to be in fine riding costume and carry riding crops. The man wears a fitted coat, brocade vest, ascot, plaid trousers and a high silk hat. The woman wears a long skirt with train, fitted bodice, high stiff collar with bow tie, and a high silk hat. Several small sailboats and a canoe are on the river in a bucolic background scene while a group of homes and a church or large municipal building are on a hill overlooking the river.."", 'The print was produced by Sarony & Major. Napoleon Sarony (1821–1896) was born in Quebec and trained under several lithography firms including Currier & Ives and H.R. Robinson. Sarony was also known for his successful experiments in early photography, eventually developing a cabinet-sized camera. In 1846, Sarony partnered with another former apprentice of Nathaniel Currier, Henry B. Major and created Sarony & Major Lithography firm. Joseph F. Knapp joined the firm in 1857. Sarony, Major & Knapp earned a solid reputation for lithography and the company was especially known for its fine art chromolithography. Unfortunately, by the 1870s, the firm shifted focus to the more profitable area of advertising. It also expanded to become the conglomerate known as the American Lithographic Company, successfully producing calendars, advertising cards and posters. In 1930 they were bought out by Consolidated Graphics.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Lithograph'] ['lithograph'] ['hand-colored (image production method/technique)', 'ink (overall material)', 'paper (overall material)']",4,lithograph,['Walking'],4,furnishings

Since the family never sat for a formal portrait, artists relied on earlier photographs of its members to create their compositions, portraying the family members as they would have appeared at the start of Lincoln’s presidency. This post-1880 black and white print depicts the family members as they would have appeared at the start of Lincoln’s presidency. At left, a bespectacled President Lincoln sits reading from a book. Opposite him, sits Mary Todd Lincoln, holding a rose on her lap. Between them stand their three children, Tad, Willie, and Robert. In the background, the Capitol building is visible between two segments of drapery. By the time this print was produced sometime after 1880, Robert was the only surviving Lincoln child, Willie having died in 1862 and Tad in 1871.', 'This print was produced by the lithography firm of Kurz & Allison. Louis Kurz (1835–1921) was an Austrian immigrant who settled in Chicago during the 1850s, where he formed a partnership with Henry Seifert of Milwaukee. He later fought for the Union Army during the Civil War. After the conflict he co-founded the Chicago Lithographic Company. When the company’s assets were destroyed during the Chicago Fire of 1871, Kurz started a new business with his partner, financial backer, and business manager, Alexander Allison. Their partnership is noted for producing a commemorative print series of Civil War battle scenes, several of which are in the NMAH’s collections.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Lithograph'] ['Lithograph'] ['paper (overall material)', 'ink (overall material)']",1,lithograph,,2,undefined

As the subtitle explains, “He wasted his Substance with Riotous living.”', 'The parable of the Prodigal Son or the Lost Son is among the best-known Christian morality tales and is found in Luke 15:11-32. The youngest of the two sons demands his share of his father’s estate which the father gives him. Shortly after, he runs off and squanders the wealth “in wild living.” Finding himself destitute, he returns to his father, repents his ways, and begs to be allowed to serve as a hired servant. The father rejoices at the return of his son “who was lost and is found.” Meanwhile, the obedient, older son is angry and refuses to join the celebration. His father pleads with him to forgive and to understand his joy.', 'This print was produced by E.B. Kellogg and E.C. Kellogg and Kelloggs & Thayer after an engraving by Amos Doolittle. Edmund Burke Kellogg (1809-1872) and Elijah Chapman Kellogg (1811-1881) were brothers of the founder of the Kellogg lithography firm, Daniel Wright Kellogg (1807-1874). After D.W. Kellogg moved west, his two brothers took over the family lithography firm in 1840 and changed the name to E.B. & E.C. Kellogg. The younger two of the four Kellogg brothers, they were responsible for the continued success of the family firm. These two brothers were also involved in the eventual partnerships between the company and Horace Thayer in 1845 or 1846, John Chenevard Comstock (1818-1862) in 1848 and William Henry Bulkeley (1840-1902) in 1867. The print was produced by the lithography firm of Kelloggs & Thayer. Kelloggs and Thayer was the first partnership formed by Elijah Chapman Kellogg (1811-1881) and Edmund Burke Kellogg (1809-1872) after they took over the family firm from their brother Daniel Wright Kellogg (1807-1874). Horace Thayer (1811-c. 1874) was a map dealer and in 1845 or 1846 the men opened a shop in New York. The partnership appears to have dissolved in 1847. In 1848, the Kellogg brothers formed a new partnership with John Chenevard Comstock (1818-1862).']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Lithograph'] ['lithograph'] ['ink (overall material)', 'paper (overall material)']",1,lithograph,"['Courtship, love', 'Drinking', 'Eating', 'Lighting', 'Furnishings']",6,flowers

There is little evidence that Smith himself preached to Native American tribes, however others did at his behest until government officials pushed missionaries off reservation land.

Robinson. Edward Williams Clay (1799-1857) was an American painter, illustrator, and printmaker born in Philadelphia. He attended law school but left the legal field to become an engraver. In the late 1820s, he worked on a series of stereotypical racist prints entitled Life in Philadelphia depicting African American life. He also created portraits and sheet music covers, but after 1831 he specialized in political cartoons. He moved from Philadelphia to New York City in 1837 and often worked with Henry R. Robinson. Failing eyesight eventually led Clay to give up art, and he again relocated, this time to Delaware, where he worked as a court clerk. He died of tuberculosis in New York in 1857.', 'Henry R.

In 1842 he was arrested for selling obscene pictures and books in his print and book shop.

In addition to Lind’s vocal gifts, she was greatly admired as a model of piety, simplicity, and generosity. In 1849, although only 29 years old, she announced her retirement from opera and turned to performing Romantic and Swedish folk songs. She resumed her operatic career in 1850, when she launched an American tour under the management of the showman P. T. Barnum.

At the age of 17, he headed west to the Gold Rush town of Benecia, California, where he worked as a strong man and enforcer in labor and political disputes. His reputation for informal brawling earned him the nickname the “Benecia Boy” and captured the attention of an English trainer named Jim Cusick, who moved with Heenan back to New York. Because fighting was illegal in the United States at that time, Heenan participated in his first national heavyweight bout in Canada in 1858. He lost the match to reigning champion John Morrissey in what some claimed to be an unfair fight because of crowd interference. After Morrissey retired from the ring, Heenan became national champion by default. He fought his second match—this time against Tom Sayers in 1860—in a field in Farnborough, Hampshire, England. Bare knuckle fighting was also illegal in England, and the confrontation attracted widespread public attention. It quickly turned brutal and chaotic, and ended in a draw after five rounds when the police threatened to intervene.', 'The match has been described as the first world title fight, and it led to the establishment of a boxing code of conduct that included three-minute rounds, mandatory gloves, and ten-second counts after knockdowns. Heenan lost his third and final world title match, also in England, to a fighter named Tom King in 1863. Again, there were charges that the fight had been unfair, this time because of biased calls by the referee. Heenan also later claimed he’d been drugged. He devoted his final years to the gambling business. He died at the age of 38 after contracting tuberculosis in what was then the Wyoming territory. Heavy press coverage turned Heenan into a superstar, celebrated not only in prints, but in advertisements, poems, ballads, and theatrical productions.', 'This lithograph was produced by the lithographic firm of E. B. & E. C Kellogg and published and sold by George Whiting. Edmund Burke Kellogg and Elijah Chapman Kellogg were younger brothers of the founder of the Kellogg lithography firm, Daniel Wright Kellogg. After Daniel Wright Kellogg moved west, his two brothers took over the family lithography firm in 1840 and changed the name to E.B. & E.C. Kellogg.

Gratacap created a specially treated leather helmet with a segmented “comb” design that led to unparalleled durability and strength. The elongated rear brim (also known as a duckbill or beavertail) and frontpiece were 19th century innovations that remain the most identifiable feature of firefighter’s helmets. The body of the helmet was primarily designed to deflect falling debris, the rear brim prevented water from running down firefighters’ backs, and their sturdy crowns could aid, if necessary, in breaking windows.', 'This leather fire helmet was used during the 19th century, likely in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The helmet has eight combs, with a metal eagle frontpiece holder mounted on the crown. The hat is missing its front frontpiece, but the rear brim features a gold painted image of a fire hydrant with attached gushing hose, flanked by the initials “FA.” This was the logo of the Fire Association of Philadelphia, an insurance company founded by a group of eleven volunteer engine companies and five volunteer hose companies in 1817. The hat likely belonged to a fire company that was part of the Fire Association of Philadelphia.

Bachelder’s machine sewed with a chain-stitch. He did not claim this chain-stitch mechanism as it was patented earlier in February in 1849 by Charles Morey and Joseph B. Johnson of Massachusetts. Instead he focused on improving the cloth feed. On this model, Bachelder used a wide continuous leather belt inserted with sharp pins to hold the cloth and enable the leather belt to move the cloth forward as it was being sewn. After being stitched, the fabric would be disengaged from the points by a curved piece of metal. This was the first patent for a continuous sewing, intermittent feeding mechanism.', 'Although Bachelder did not manufacture his sewing machine, his patent and later reissues of it were bought by I. M. Singer, and became one of the central patents to form the Sewing Machine Combination in 1856. This organization consisted of three sewing machine manufacturers, I. M. Singer Co., Wheeler & Wilson Co., and the Grover & Baker Co., and the inventor, Elias Howe Jr., who all agreed to pool their important patents and stop patent litigations between them. This allowed them to move ahead with manufacturing and marketing of their own sewing machine and collect license fees from other companies wanting to use their patents.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Patent Model'] ['sewing machine patent model'] ['wood (overall material)', 'metal (overall material)', 'leather (overall material)']",6,paint,,2,undefined

An evening bodice was included with the ensemble. The lace collar is of the period, but not original to the dress.', 'After Abraham Lincoln’s death, Mary went into mourning and remained in widow’s clothes until her own death in 1882.

In 1916 Grimsley’s son, John, sold the ensemble to Mrs. Julian James for the Smithsonian’s First Ladies Collection.', 'John Grimsley attributed this dress to a “seamstress of exceptional ability” who “made nearly all of Mrs. Lincoln’s gowns.” Although he mistook her name as “Ann,” he most likely was referring to Elizabeth Keckly.', 'The Civil War made it particularly important that the ceremonial functions of the administration appear dignified and competent. This public image helped calm domestic critics and reassure foreign governments, especially England and France, which were being courted by the Confederacy. The Lincolns faced the challenge of maintaining proper decorum without appearing self-indulgent when so many were sacrificing so much. Their background made this task even more difficult, as they had to overcome eastern stereotypes of “uncultured” westerners.', 'Mary Lincoln took her role as first lady very seriously. Some newspapers portrayed her as “the republican queen,” elegant and admirable at public occasions. Others criticized her for conspicuous consumption in time of war and sacrifice.

Romantic scenes picture devoted husbands with their contented, dutiful wives. In these prints, young women educated in reading, music, needlework, the arts, the language of flowers, basic math and science are subjugated to their family’s needs.', 'These prints became popular as lithography was introduced to 19th Century Americans. As a new art form, it was affordable for the masses and provided a means to share visual information by crossing the barriers of race, class and language. Sentimental prints encouraged the artistic endeavors of schoolgirls and promoted the ambitions of amateur artists, while serving as both moral instruction and home or business decoration. They are a pictorial record of our romanticized past.', 'This three-quarter length hand colored print is of a young dark haired woman holding a small nosegay of flowers standing outdoors. She is resting on a stone railing, wearing a blue dress with lace around her neck and wrists. A river flows through the hills in the scene behind her.', 'The lithographer Elijah Chapman Kellogg (1811–1881) was the youngest of the four Kellogg brothers, all of whom were lithographers.
